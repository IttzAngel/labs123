- you cannot start a variable name with a number
- Math.pow(x, y) is for exponents, x is number and y is exponent
- never use a java reserved word for a variable name
- there are primitive variables and reference variables
- java cares about type, it needs to make sense
- make sure the value makes sense for the variable type and fits correctly
- there is no object variable, it is an object reference variable
- declare the refernce variables, then create the objects, then assign the objects to the reference variables
- arrays are also objects and can be used as such
- using the . is like pressing a button to use a method or instance variable
